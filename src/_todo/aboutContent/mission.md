Actionable Information for Disasters and Development (AIDD) labs’ mission is to design information systems using integrative and iterative methods that bring together disciplines and ultimately prioritize populations in need during disasters. Led by Dr. Sabine Loos and housed at the University of Michigan, AIDD labs aims to design information systems that continuously improve upon (and in some cases, break down) current disaster data by including the opinions and voices of communities and organizations that historically have not been prioritized in disaster data development, by developing data and models that can be implemented in data-limited regions, by understanding how data has been developed and used in the past to better design our future.
