AIDD labs designs information by first understanding what the needs are for itâ€”either by engaging with those living in communities at risk to disaster or those responding to and managing those risks. We then develop approaches to address these needs by leveraging statistical learning, crowdsourcing, remote sensing, among other techniques. Importantly, we consider the implications of the information we design through evaluating the effects of data-driven decisions and continued engagement with our users.

Our general approach to our research include multiple disciplines necessary to develop more holistic disaster information, blending engineering, the earth sciences, the social sciences, and information systems. We also try to include the opinions of users as much as possible to improve our data development, especially those who have historically been left out of disaster data development and decision making.
