AIDD Labs aims to understand the use of information for disaster decisions to ultimately develop improved information systems for the future, both in the US and internationally. Our research can take multiple forms, from evaluating where crowdsourced hazard information comes from to developing statistical methods to estimate disaster impacts. We also consider various aspects of disaster information, whether it be the hazard, its physical impacts, its social impacts, or a combination of the three. A few of our research areas include:

- Rapidly estimating post-disaster building damage
- Conducting user needs assessments for disaster information
- Surveying and modeling post-disaster recovery
- Designing user and equity-centered risk information
- Evaluating differences in crowdsourced hazard data responses
