            <h1>Team</h1>
            Our team is a group of disaster analysts with multiple backgrounds&mdash;including
            humanitarian engineering, civil engineering, statistics&mdash;and we're looking to
            grow. We strive to conduct convergent research, blending our knowledge of data
            and statistics on disasters and/or the built environment with an understanding
            of the social and natural systems that surround them. Therefore, our team
            members employ multiple methods bridging multiple disciplines.
