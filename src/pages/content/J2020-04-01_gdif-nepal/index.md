abstract: "While unprecedented amounts of building damage data are now produced after earthquakes, stakeholders do not have a systematic method to synthesize and evaluate damage information, thus leaving many datasets unused. We propose a Geospa-tial Data Integration Framework (G-DIF) that employs regression kriging to combine a sparse sample of accurate field surveys with spatially exhaustive, though uncertain , damage data from forecasts or remote sensing. The framework can be implemented after an earthquake to produce a spatially-distributed estimate of damage and, importantly, its uncertainty. An example application with real data collected after the 2015 Nepal earthquake illustrates how regression kriging can combine a diversity of datasets-and downweight uninformative sources-reflecting its ability to accommodate context-specific variations in data type and quality. Through a sensitivity analysis on the number of field surveys, we demonstrate that with only a few surveys, this method can provide more accurate results than a standard engineering forecast."

INTRODUCTION 
From rapid engineering forecasts to crowdsourced maps, unprecedented amounts of building damage data are now being produced after earthquakes. The 2010 Haiti earthquake was the first time that response and recovery stakeholders had access to this amount of damage data, due to both technological advancements in remote sensing data acquisition and mandates to make that data openly available after major disasters (Corbane et al., 2011; Kerle and Hoffman, 2013). In fact, after 2010 there was a spike in the number of damage-related maps posted on ReliefWeb—a global information sharing site devoted to humanitarian disasters—in response to
