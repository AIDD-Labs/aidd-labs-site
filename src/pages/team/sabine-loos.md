## Bio

Sabine Loos is the PI of AIDD labs and an Assistant Professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at University of Michigan. Broadly, herÂ research surrounds the development of disaster information that centers users and the human experience. She applies statistical learning, risk analysis, and user-centered design techniques to develop tools that inform effective and equitable disaster risk reduction, response, and recovery. She has worked across Nepal, Singapore, and New Zealand to gain firsthand experience of the impacts from disasters. The transdisciplinary nature of her work has led her to collaborate with Kathmandu Living Labs, the World Bank, NASA-JPL, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and others. She also co-chairs the Natural Hazards Center Researchers' Meetings and co-founded the Risk & Resilience DAT/Artathon. 

Prior to UM, Sabine was a Mendenhall Fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey in collaboration with the Natural Hazards Center at CU Boulder, working on developing socially equitable earthquake risk products. Sabine completed her PhD in Civil Engineering between Stanford University and Earth Observatory of Singapore at Nanyang Technological University, her MS in Sustainable Design & Construction from Stanford University, and BS in Civil Engineering from the Ohio State University.
