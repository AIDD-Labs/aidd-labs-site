## Bio
Margaret Miles is a PhD Researcher at the University of Michigan Civil Engineering Department. She focuses on human-centered design methodologies and data analysis to address natural hazard risk and resilience. Her interests lie in bridging the gap between human centered designed interventions, which typically are in the qualitative and social space, and data analysis which does not always have design equity integrated into it. Previously, she worked at Engineers Without Borders USA in Colorado, taught English in Alicante, Spain, and did her undergraduate studies in Systems Engineering at The Ohio State University. In her free time she likes to scrapbook/paint, or do anything outdoorsy.
