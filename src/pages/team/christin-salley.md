## Bio
Dr. Christin Salley is a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow with the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS). In this role, she is given a Science Mentor, Dr. Sabine Loos (Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering), and an AI Mentor, Dr. Lu Wang (Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering). She conducts work at the intersection of community resilience and AI to assess social systems for equitable processes related to disasters and natural hazards.

Dr. Salley graduated with her PhD in Civil Engineering, with a concentration in Construction and Infrastructure Systems, from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Her dissertation, entitled “Enhancing Access to Emergency Management Efforts: Exposing Disparities, Detecting Needs, and Safeguarding Infrastructure,” outlined and examined three particular issues within emergency response systems to enhance accessibility for those experiencing crisis events such as natural disasters. Dr. Salley focused on marginalized populations, which have a long-standing history of experiencing inequities in emergency management as it pertains to aspects such as distribution of aid, as procedural fairness, and longitudinal community impacts.
