## Bio
Simone Curtis was a Masters Researcher with AIDD labs in the Civil Engineering program at the University of Michigan. Broadly, she aimed to create human-centered tools that inform equitable disaster risk management decisions. Her research surrounded the development of equity-aware risk modeling approaches that quantify the inequitable distribution of risk to extend the traditional risk modeling framework. She is also interested in developing accessible risk models by studying visual risk communication. Prior to UM, Simone received her BSc in Architectural Engineering with an emphasis in Structures from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2023.
