## Bio

Eli Knodel is a geospatial data scientist with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) and a researcher with AIDD labs at University of Michigan. 

Prior to coming to Ann Arbor, Eli got his bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Colorado School of Mines and worked at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
At the USGS, he developed software and performed statistical analyses, including an analysis of the global accessibility of "Did You Feel It?" (DYFI), an earthquake information product from the USGS that uses crowdsourced data.
With AIDD labs, he has published his analysis of DYFI and developed FieldImage, which is a tool for processing, organizing, and mapping field-collected reconnaissance photographs.
