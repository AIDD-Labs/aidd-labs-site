## Bio
**Dr. Xin Wei**
[Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow with the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS)](https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/xin-wei/)

He will be working with [Prof. Sabine Loos](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/loos-sabine/), [Prof. F. Estéfan T. Garcia](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/garcia-f-estefan-t/), and [Prof. Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly](https://sites.google.com/view/elizabethbondi) to explore integrated AI-Physics solutions for understanding the impact of past landslides on communities and developing risk assessment tools to mitigate future impacts.

His research interests include risk, reliability, and resilience analysis of natural hazards under climate change, leveraging interdisciplinary approaches such as remote sensing, geospatial modeling, data-driven and physics-based models. Before joining the University of Michigan, he earned his PhD in Civil Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervision of Prof. Lulu Zhang. He was also a visiting scholar in Prof. Paolo Gardoni’s group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
