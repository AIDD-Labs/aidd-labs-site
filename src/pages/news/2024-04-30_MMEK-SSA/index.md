Several AIDD Lab projects were presented on at the [2024 Seismological Society of America (SSA) Meeting](https://meetings.seismosoc.org/) this year. 

Marísa convened a session on ''Creating Actionable Earthquake Information Products" with co-conveners David Wald (USGS), Tiegan Hobbs (Natural Resources Canada), and Sabine Loos. This session included many oral and poster presentations from multiple agencies and researchers around the world.
