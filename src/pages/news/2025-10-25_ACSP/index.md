Presentation and poster at ACSP 2025 exploring why equity in post-disaster housing recovery fades from policy to practice, using comparative PDNA analysis and Nepal’s 2015 earthquake recovery as case study.
---

The study introduces **“equity as governance rationality”**, arguing that inequitable recovery results not from data absence but from how governance transforms moral intent into administrative order.  
- **Governmentality:** Technical control replaces political deliberation.  
- **Anti-politics:** Structural injustices are reframed as technical issues.  
- **Justice reframing:** Equity must be re-politicized as a structural governance principle, not an administrative task.
