The study introduces **“equity as governance rationality”**, arguing that inequitable recovery results not from data absence but from how governance transforms moral intent into administrative order.  
- **Governmentality:** Technical control replaces political deliberation.  
- **Anti-politics:** Structural injustices are reframed as technical issues.  
- **Justice reframing:** Equity must be re-politicized as a structural governance principle, not an administrative task.

Achieving equitable recovery requires:
- Embedding **inclusion and recognition** within governance systems, not only policy texts.  
- Treating **data as political knowledge**, informing redistributive decisions.  
- Sustaining **equity commitments beyond donor cycles** through institutional reforms that enable local discretion and contextual adaptation.
