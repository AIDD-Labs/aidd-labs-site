This year's conference was hosted at the Colorado School of Mines and brings together a group of like-minded cross-discipinary researchers engaged in humanitarian work. This year's IEEE GHTC 2025 showcased “Technologies in Context” as its annual theme. This theme encourages authors to assemble diverse teams including community members articulating the need and/or desire for technology, relevant policymakers, and/or interdisciplinary academic teams to describe their technological intervention in social, cultural, environmental, economic, and/or political contexts.

Margaret presented her work, **"Understanding Public Perceptions and Adoption of Community Parametric Reciprocal Disaster Insurance in Sarasota County, FL". Margaret introduced people to Carol, a homeowner in a high-risk area without financial resources to cover increasing damage. The presentation included preliminary results from a semi-structured interview study focused on identifying gaps and potential users on parametric community insurance in Sarasota, FL.
