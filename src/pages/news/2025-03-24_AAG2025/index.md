### Sabine Loos and Apil K C participate in session on Disaster Recovery through a Geographic Lens
Sabine Loos co-convened two sessions titled "Disaster Recovery through a Geographic Lens" with [Hannah Friedrich, PhD Candidate at University of Arizona](https://hannahkfriedrich.com/) and [Dr. Ronald Schumann, Associate Professor at University of North Texas](https://hps.unt.edu/people/ronald-schumann-iii-phd.html). This session brought together many researchers drawing from geography through spatial analysis, mixed methods, and application to study disaster recovery. 

Apil K C, presented in this session on "Are post-disaster housing approaches successful? Rethinking through household satisfaction"

Both sessions were well attended and encouraged discussion on how we can bring forward the field of disaster recovery studies.

### Major Zeng and Shriya Kethireddy presented posters on recovery and access
Major Zeng presented her work on "Modeling Rural Service Access and Isolation in Disasters: A Case Study of Earthquake-Triggered Landslides in Nepal"
