description: "In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, rapid information about regional impact (e.g., building damage, fatalities, financial loss,etc.) is crticial for both short-term impact assessement and long-term recovery planning.  However, traditional methods such as buliding damage surveys do not satsify the urgent data needs that arise in immediate post-earthquake scenarios. This collaborative project seeks to develop a framework that integrates high-resolution commerical satellite data, machine learning, and loss estimation to rapidly generate regional earthquake impact metrics. Findings from the project will promote actionable post-earthquake impact assessment while also supporting long-term recovery planning in the wake of devastating seismic events. The project is supported by the NASA CESRA program. "
