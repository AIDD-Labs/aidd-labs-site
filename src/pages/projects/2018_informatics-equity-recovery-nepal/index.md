Informatics for Equitable Recovery is a transdisciplinary research collaboration that brings together data scientists, engineers, social scientists and civic organizations to improve post-disaster information systems and decision support tools. Example use cases for these information systems include post-disaster needs assessments (PDNAs) and recovery aid policy design.

After the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, the need for holistic post-disaster information systems became even clearer. We developed novel methods combining spatial statistics, field surveys, social science, and machine learning models to develop rapid damage and need estimates that reflect the different ways that disaster impacts are felt by communities and enable these estimates to be used meaningfully in the recovery process. We also evaluated long-term household recovery outcomes as they relate post-disaster recovery policies put in place after the 2015 earthquake.
