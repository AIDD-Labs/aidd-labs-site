description: As natural hazards are becoming more frequent, insurance companies
  are withdrawing from high-risk areas in the United States, leaving homeowners
  without adequate financial protection. While parametric insurance presents a
  potential solution by offering rapid payouts based on predefined hazard
  triggers, its adoption by communities and households remains limited due to
  multiple factors, including potential misalignment between what payouts are
  provided and community expectations.  This study aims to explore the
  feasibility of reciprocal parametric insurance  at the community level,
  working with households, business owners, and city planners in Sarasota, FL.
