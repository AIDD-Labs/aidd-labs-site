Information provided by earthquake affected populations can provide situational awareness for responders and fill gaps in scientific understanding of an event. We are evaluating the U.S. Geological Survey’s “Did You Feel It?” (DYFI) system, an internet tool that crowdsources shaking intensity observations, to understand global user interaction with this system. **Specifically, we want to know who responds (and does not respond) to DYFI? and for what reasons.** Our findings is helping the USGS identify where to invest resources when updating the design of and communication for DYFI.
