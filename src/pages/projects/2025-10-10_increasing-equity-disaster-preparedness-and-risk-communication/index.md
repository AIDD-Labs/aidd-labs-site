description: Accessible hazard risk information enables individuals and
  communities to make critical adaptive or mitigative decisions. However, most
  disaster risk resources are designed for the average person (e.g., white,
  middle class, with postsecondary education), leaving marginalized
  communities—who perceive and respond to hazard information
  differently—underprepared and vulnerable. This project will develop and
  implement a community needs assessment and an interactive risk information
  framework to address the preparedness and risk information needs of
  marginalized communities. Findings will help governments refine strategies and
  centralize information through an equity-focused GIS platform, offering
  tailored emergency preparedness resources to communities and officials. The
  initiative aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of governments and strengthen
  resilience at the community level for tens of millions of Americans, with the
  potential for broader impact at a global scale.
