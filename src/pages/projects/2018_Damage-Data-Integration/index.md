description: "From remote sensing to crowdsourcing, an increasing amount of data is becoming available after disasters. However, more data does not always mean more informed disaster responders. In fact, all of this information can be overwhelming to emergency managers who are making decisions in a fast-paced response environment. We develop a method to integrate forecasts and remote sensing-derived estimates of damage with a limited sample of field surveys to rapidly estimate building damage after a disaster. This method relies on geostatistical methods, primarily regression kriging. We show that data integration can work among multiple contexts, with different patterns of damage and different kinds of data available." # insert a one sentence description here
